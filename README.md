# Gather UA Jobs

This plugin was created by Rachel Carden. Please [use the issues area](https://github.com/bamawebtide/gather-ua-jobs/issues) to submit ideas and report any bugs.

### Gathering UA Faculty Jobs
This WordPress plugin "gathers" University of Alabama faculty jobs and allows you to be notified, via email, when jobs containing certain keywords are posted.

You can also use the gather_ua_faculty_jobs() function to gather the job information and use at will.

### Gathering UA Staff Jobs
At this point in time, this plugin only gathers information for faculty jobs. The [staff jobs website](http://staffjobs.ua.edu/jobAlert.html) does, however, have the capability to send you job alerts (filtered by keyword or category) via email. You can [setup UA staff job alerts](http://staffjobs.ua.edu/jobAlert.html) on their website.
